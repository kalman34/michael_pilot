Mic 1,"Michael has his own standards of behaving. As a student, he would tell on fellow classmates whom he saw break school rules, like cheating on tests. In fact, he claimed to his friends that never once in his life has he thought about cheating.Michael recently started making attempts to keep up to date with cultural knowledge. He read a book about Europe, sat in a music appreciation workshop, and eats in fashionable ethnic restaurants. When being with friends, he often talks at length about foreign cultures and art. Michael spends a great amount of his time in search of what he likes to call excitement. He has already climbed Mt. McKinley, done some skydiving, shot the Colorado rapids in a kayak, driven in a demolition derby, and piloted a jet-powered boat without knowing much about boats. He has been injured, and even risked death, a number of times.Other than business engagements, Michael’s contacts with people are surprisingly limited. He feels he doesn’t really need to rely on anyone.Once Michael makes up his mind to do something, it is as good as done no matter how long it might take or how difficult the going might be. Only rarely does he change his mind even when it might be better if he did.In order to improve his life, Michael tries to save money. He uses coupons, buys things on sale, and avoids donating money to charity or lending money to friends."

Mic 3,"Michael is very close to his parents. He makes sure to have dinner with them every week, and calls them often.  He is consistent with this level of engagement, even when it is occasionally at the expense of seeing friends.Michael is very detail-oriented and puts care and focus into every project that comes his way, often producing very high quality work.  Sometimes, though, this approach can overcomplicate simple tasks or make him reluctant to call things he works on “finished,” so it takes him longer to complete assignments.  Sometimes he can miss deadlines as a result. Michael knows a lot about history and literature from reading frequently, and is very articulate. He tends to talk at length about the things he’s learned about most recently, even if they aren’t directly relevant to the topic of conversation.Michael likes to avoid spending money as a general rule.
